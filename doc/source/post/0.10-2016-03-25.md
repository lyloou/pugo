`PuGo` 0.10.0 **Beta** is released. There are many major changes:

## TOML support

`PuGo` support `TOML` to define meta and front-matter. And now, `PuGo` converts all default data to TOML instead of INI. But INI is continuing supporting.

You can read the new default `meta.toml` to learn about the TOML format.
